**Project Overview**

The project is an object detection system that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify and estimate the distance of objects in real-time using a webcam feed. The system utilizes the YOLOv8 model for object detection and text-to-speech functionality to verbally announce detected objects. The primary goal is to create an interactive, user-friendly interface that simplifies object detection and encourages accessibility for non-technical users.
The core methodology involves capturing video frames, processing them through the YOLOv8 model to detect objects, estimating distances based on object heights, and converting the results into speech.

**Key Features**

- Real-time Object Detection: The system can detect objects in real-time using a webcam feed, allowing users to monitor their environment continuously.
- Distance Estimation: Based on the detected object's height and the focal length of the camera, the system estimates and displays the distance between the object and the camera.
- Text-to-Speech Announcements: The system converts detected object names into speech, enabling users with visual impairments or those focusing on other tasks to receive audio notifications.
- Customizable Confidence Thresholds: Users can adjust the confidence thresholds for object detection and distance estimation, tailoring the system to their specific needs.
- Object Tracking: The system maintains a history of detected objects, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the environment.
- User-friendly Interface: The custom Tkinter-based GUI simplifies user interaction, allowing users to start and stop detection with ease.
